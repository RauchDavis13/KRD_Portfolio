          <p className="aboutFrame">
            I was hired for the function of Trade Marketing with a focus on

            exist previously. In my first year at this company, due to the
            impact of the new processes and reporting capabilities added, I was
            1 of 2 people in the North America division to earn multiple exceeds
            in my review.
